# LED-Display-EAGLE
Designed an LED Display PCB using Arduino UNO (R3) on Autodesk EAGLE. This was the final project of a course I'm pursuing on Udemy and successfully created the PCB without any errors.  I learnt a lot about design rules and design issues that arise while designing any PCB and, for that matter, this design taught me how to tackle those issues related to EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and how to achieve high-frequency and high-speed circuits with minimal noise production.
